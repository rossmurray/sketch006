generate random intervals
generate random colors
allow selection between several different pattern generation behaviors
  uniform random everything
  generate intervals by iteratively mutating
  expert systems like make big patches of cool and small stripes of bright
  sometimes alter the weft pattern slightly (change a color, divide a strip, etc)
  etc
look into changing mask implementation (use a webgl cutout blend mode?)
  current one uses full cpu to render
animate between random patterns
  create a fixed-size pool of stripes, all identical texture.
    with a configurable tint for color, and dynamically resized.
    use this pool of stripes to "render" any requested pattern.
    this system will allow the same stripes to be animated between patterns,
      and allow new ones to join or extra ones to leave (shrink or move offscreen or fade)
  several animation behaviors
    simple translate
    a "blend" where stripes never move, only get wider/thinner and change color.
    talls shrink down while new talls replace by growing from above (on both axes)
    random swaps between warp and weft
    etc
